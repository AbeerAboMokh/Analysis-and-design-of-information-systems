Part A:
The store "Artists-" is focused on art supplies, home goods, office supplies, and solutions. You've assessed the current state of operations including employee management, financial management, inventory management, product management, and customer service across three main areas: product sales, workshops, and home deliveries (especially relevant in the COVID era).
detailed these requirements using UC (Use Case) diagrams, selecting six main UCs and directly related CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions. UCs such as online purchase, workshop registration, entering work shifts, and providing feedback on other employees are highlighted, alongside a CD (Class Diagram).
Part B:
You've created sequence diagrams and state diagrams.

This all suggests a thorough approach to understanding and improving the operational efficiency and customer service of the "Artists-" store.
